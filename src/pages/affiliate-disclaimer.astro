      <h2>Transparency Statement</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
      <p>
        Affiliate links are special URLs that contain a unique code identifying us as the referrer. When you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase or sign up for a service, we may earn a commission at no additional cost to you.
      </p>
